Birmingham was named after Birmingham, England. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry. In the 1950s and 1960s Birmingham received national and international attention as a center of the civil rights struggle for African-Americans. A watershed in the civil rights movement occurred in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested that Martin Luther King come to Birmingham for protests. These protests were ultimately successful, leading not only to desegregation of public accommodations in Birmingham but also the Civil Rights Act of 1964.'

    info : 'The city has hosted multiple international events, including the 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo was originally a village called Edo and adopted a stringent policy of seclusion. This prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports. Edo was renamed Tokyo (Eastern Capital) on September 3, 1868. Tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.'

It became a destination for cattle drives traveling north from Texas to Kansas railroads, earning it the nickname "Cowtown". In 1914 and 1915, deposits of oil and natural gas were discovered in nearby Butler County. The money generated by the oil boom enabled local entrepreneurs to invest in the nascent airplane-manufacturing industry. In 1917, Clyde Cessna built his Cessna Comet in Wichita, the first aircraft built in the city. The city became such a center of the airplane industry that the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce dubbed it the "Air Capital of the World" in 1929.'
